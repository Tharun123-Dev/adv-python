# A PAN (Permanent Account Number) is a 10-character alphanumeric code issued by the Indian Income Tax Department.

# It’s in the format: AAAAA9999A

# First 5 characters → letters (alphabets)

# Next 4 characters → numbers (digits)

# Last character → letter (alphabet)

#  Example: ABCDE1234F

#  For security reasons, never share your real PAN card number publicly.

# Would you like me to explain how to verify a PAN number or just its structure/format?

# You said:
# Regex
# ChatGPT said:
# For PAN card number regex, you can use this pattern:

# ^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}$
# Explanation:
# ^ → Start of string

# [A-Z]{5} → First 5 characters must be uppercase letters

# [0-9]{4} → Next 4 characters must be digits

# [A-Z]{1} → Last character must be an uppercase letter

# $ → End of string

# ✅ Valid Example: ABCDE1234F
# ❌ Invalid Example: abcde1234f (lowercase not allowed)

# 👉 If you want case-insensitive match (allow lowercase also), use:

# ^[A-Za-z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Za-z]{1}$
# Do you want me to also give you a Python code snippet to validate PAN using this regex?

# 🔹 Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python
# Regex is used for searching, matching, and manipulating text patterns. Python provides it via the re module.

# 1. Basic Functions
# Function	Description	Example
# re.match()	Matches pattern at the beginning of a string	re.match(r'Hello', 'Hello World') ✅
# re.search()	Searches pattern anywhere in string	re.search(r'World', 'Hello World') ✅
# re.findall()	Returns all matches in a list	re.findall(r'\d', 'a1b2c3') → ['1','2','3']
# re.sub()	Replaces text matching a pattern	re.sub(r'\d', '*', 'a1b2') → 'a*b*'
# 2. Meta Characters (Special Symbols)
# Symbol	Meaning	Example Match
# .	Any character except newline	a.c → abc, axc
# ^	Start of string	^Hello → Hello World
# $	End of string	world$ → Hello world
# *	0 or more repetitions	ab* → a, ab, abb, abbb
# +	1 or more repetitions	ab+ → ab, abb, abbb
# ?	0 or 1 occurrence	colou?r → color, colour
# {n}	Exactly n times	\d{3} → 123
# {n,}	n or more times	\d{2,} → 12, 123, 12345
# {n,m}	Between n and m times	\d{2,4} → 12, 123, 1234
# []	Character set	[abc] → a, b, c
# [^ ]	Negation	[^0-9] → any non-digit
# |	OR	cat|dog → cat or dog
# 3. Character Classes
# Class	Meaning
# \d	Digit → [0-9]
# \D	Non-digit
# \w	Word character → [A-Za-z0-9_]
# \W	Non-word character

# \S	Non-whitespace
# 4. Anchors
# Symbol	Meaning
# ^	Start of string
# $	End of string
# \b	Word boundary
# \B	Not a word boundary
# 5. Grouping & Capturing
# Pattern	Meaning
# (abc)	Capturing group
# (?:abc)	Non-capturing group
# (?P<name>abc)	Named capturing group
# (ab)+	Group repetition
# 6. Examples
# ✅ Email validation

# pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w{2,3}$'
# ✅ Mobile number (10 digits)

# pattern = r'^[6-9]\d{9}$'

# You said:
# One by one
# ChatGPT said:
# Perfect! Let's go step by step, one by one, so it’s easy to understand. We’ll start with the basic idea of Regex and then move to each type.

# Step 1: What is Regex?
# Regex (Regular Expression) is a special string pattern used to search, match, and manipulate text.

# Think of it as a “search blueprint” for text.

# Python has a module re for regex.

# Example:

# import re
# text = "Hello World"
# pattern = r"Hello"
# if re.match(pattern, text):
#     print("Match Found")
# Output:

# Match Found
# ✅ Key point: Regex is all about patterns, not exact text.

# Do you want me to move to Step 2: Basic Regex Functions in Python next?

# You said:
# All types one by one
# In paragrahic way
# ChatGPT said:
# Got it! Let’s go step by step, paragraph by paragraph, explaining all types of regex in Python in an easy-to-understand way.

# 1. Basic Regex Functions
# In Python, the re module provides the basic functions to work with regex. The most commonly used ones are re.match(), re.search(), re.findall(), and re.sub(). The re.match() function checks whether a pattern matches at the beginning of a string, whereas re.search() looks for the pattern anywhere in the string. The re.findall() function returns all occurrences of a pattern as a list, and re.sub() is used to replace text that matches a pattern with something else. These functions form the foundation of text searching and validation using regex in Python.

# 2. Meta Characters
# Meta characters are special symbols in regex that have a specific meaning. For example, . matches any character except a newline, ^ represents the start of a string, and $ represents the end of a string. Symbols like *, +, and ? are used for repetitions: * means 0 or more, + means 1 or more, and ? means 0 or 1 occurrence. Curly braces {n}, {n,}, and {n,m} allow you to specify exactly n, n or more, or between n and m repetitions. These meta characters give regex its powerful ability to define flexible patterns.

# 3. Character Classes
# Character classes are a shorthand for matching specific sets of characters. For instance, \d matches any digit (0–9), while \D matches any non-digit. Similarly, \w matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscore), and \W matches any non-word character. \s matches whitespace like spaces or tabs, and \S matches non-whitespace characters. Character classes make regex simpler by avoiding the need to write out large sets of possible characters.

# 4. Anchors
# Anchors are used to define positions in a string rather than matching actual characters. The ^ symbol asserts the start of a string, and $ asserts the end of a string. Word boundaries are represented by \b, which matches the position between a word character and a non-word character, and \B matches any position that is not a word boundary. Anchors help to control where a match should occur in the text, making patterns more precise.

# 5. Grouping and Capturing
# Grouping allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit in a pattern. Parentheses ( ) create a capturing group, which can be referred to later in the regex or used to extract matched content. Non-capturing groups (?: ) group characters without capturing them, and named groups (?P<name> ) let you assign a custom name to a group for easier access. Groups are also useful with repetition; for example, (ab)+ matches one or more repetitions of ab.

# 6. Real-World Examples
# Regex is extremely useful in real-world scenarios. For instance, validating a PAN card number in India can be done using the pattern ^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]$. A 10-digit mobile number starting with 6–9 can be validated using ^[6-9]\d{9}$. For email addresses, a pattern like ^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w{2,3}$ ensures a basic validation. These examples show how regex is not just theoretical but extremely practical for data validation, text processing, and searching.

# {n,m} → matches between n and m occurrences.

# [] → matches any character in the set.

# [^ ] → matches any character not in the set.

# \| → acts as OR between patterns.

# 3. Character Classes
# \d → matches any digit (0-9).

# \D → matches any non-digit.

# \w → matches any word character (letter, digit, underscore).

# \W → matches any non-word character.

# \s → matches whitespace (space, tab, newline).

# \S → matches any non-whitespace character.

# 4. Anchors
# ^ → matches start of string.

# $ → matches end of string.

# \b → matches word boundary (position between word and non-word).

# \B → matches not a word boundary.

# 5. Grouping and Capturing
# (abc) → captures a group of characters for reuse.

# (?:abc) → groups characters but does not capture.

# (?P<name>abc) → creates a named capturing group.
